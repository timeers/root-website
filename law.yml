            Each player's turn has three phases: Birdsong, Daylight, and Evening. Anything that says "at start of" a phase happens before everything else in the phase, and anything that says "at end of" happens after everything else in the phase but before the start of the next phase, if any. After a player ends Evening, the next clockwise player begins their turn. Play continues until one player has won the game (`rule:3.1`).

        - name: Piece Ownership.

        - name: Piece Manipulation.
          text: Pieces are placed and removed as defined in the Glossary (`rule:16.6.19`, `rule:16.6.22`). If you are prompted to place, take, or remove pieces but you cannot do so fully, you must place, take, or remove the maximum number possible. _(This does not allow you to avoid costs or prerequisites. You just cannot do less than the most you can.)_ If multiple pieces are removed simultaneously and that would trigger effects, remove all pieces before triggering effects.
        - name: Use of **Force**.
          plainName: Use of Force.
          text: Some effects let you **force** a player or their pieces to act. Resolve this exactly as if that player were choosing to do this, as limited by the effect. _(For example, if you force the Eyrie to move warriors, they benefit from Lords of the Forest.)_

Each time the Alliance places a sympathy token, they may score victory points. The more sympathy on the map they have, the more victory points they score. Gaining the sympathy of the people requires **supporters**. These supporters can also be put toward violent ends, inciting outright rebellion across the forest.

    - name: Overview
      pretext: The Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict while going on quests to increase his renown throughout the wood. Each time the Vagabond improves his **relationship** with another faction, or removes a warrior belonging to a faction hostile toward him, he scores victory points. He can also complete **quests** to score victory points. To move and act effectively the Vagabond must manage his pack of **items**, expanding his selection by exploring the forest ruins and providing aid to other factions.

            - name: Full Removal.
              text: Whenever an enemy player uses an effect that says it removes all enemy pieces from a clearing _(such as Alliance revolts, Favor of the Mice cards, Conspiracy bombs)_ with the Vagabond, the Vagabond damages three items.

Items on the Vagabond's faction board can be face up or face down. The Vagabond **exhausts** face-up undamaged items, flipping them face down, to take many actions.
          subchildren:
            - name: Item Tracks.
              text: When gained or flipped face up in the Satchel, `item:tea`, `item:coin`, and `item:sack` are placed face up on their matching tracks.

        - name: Dominance Cards and Coalitions.
          text: The Vagabond cannot activate a dominance card for its normal victory condition (`rule:3.3.1`). Instead, in games with four or more players, the Vagabond can activate a dominance card to form a coalition with another player, placing his score marker on that player's faction board. _(The Vagabond no longer scores points.)_ That player must have fewer victory points than each other player except the Vagabond forming the coalition, and that player cannot be in a coalition. If there is a tie for fewest victory points, he chooses one tied player. If the coalitioned player wins the game, the Vagabond also wins.

                - name: Taking Hits with Ally.
                  text: In a battle where you treat Allied warriors as your own, you can take hits by removing them. However, if you take more hits by removing Allied warriors than by damaging items during the same battle, that Allied faction becomes Hostile (`rule:9.2.9.3`) at the end of the battle. This rule overrides the condition for becoming Hostile in `rule:9.2.9.3`.
            - name: Hostile Status.
              text: If you remove a warrior of a non-Hostile faction, move their relationship marker to the Hostile box. This faction is now Hostile. Then, if this happened in battle during your turn, check for Infamy scoring (`rule:9.2.9.3.1`).
              subchildren:

  icon: cult
  children:
    - name: Overview
      pretext: Catering to the discarded creatures of the Woodland, the Lizard Cult seeks to overwhelm its foes through sheer force of will. Wherever the Cult rules clearings, it can build **gardens**, using word of mouth and beak to spread its gospel to the animals living there. The firmer its hold over the hearts of its followers, the more victory points the Cult can score by completing the proper **rituals**. While other factions spend cards to achieve their aims, the Cult acts chiefly by revealing cards and gradually gathering a set of ideal followers. These revealed cards are returned to the Cult's hand in Evening, unless discarded to score victory points. However, this gentler approach makes movement and battle difficult-the Cult can only take these actions with its radicalized **acolytes**, gained as the Cult's warriors are slaughtered while defending in battle.

    - name: Faction Rules and Abilities
      children:
        - name: Crafting.

          text: Whenever a garden is removed, the Cult must discard a random card.
        - name: The Lost Souls Pile.

      pretext: When news arrived that the Woodland on the shore of the great lake was descending into all-out war, the Riverfolk Company quickly dispatched its officers to set up shop. As other factions purchase their services, the Riverfolk can further entrench their commercial interests by establishing **trade** posts along the river, scoring victory points. So too can they score points by raw accumulation of **funds**, but a big treasury makes for an easy target, so the Riverfolk must take care in expanding their operations across the dangerous forest.

As they set up frontier outposts to show their power in the Woodland, the Duchy can sway **ministers** to the cause, scoring victory points and diverting more of the Duchy's resources.

  children:
    - name: Overview
      pretext: The Lord of the Hundreds suffers no fools and allows no dissent. During their Evening, they score points based on how well they **oppress** their foes. The more clearings they rule that have a Hundreds piece and no enemy pieces—no warriors, no buildings, nothing—the more points they score. To grow in power and attract warriors, the Hundreds must gain items and add them to their towering **Hoard**. Leading the Hundreds is the **warlord**, a warrior-demagogue whose fickle **mood** gives them an ability for the turn. Their warlord is obsessed with hoarding, so as the Hundreds gain more items, they will have fewer moods to choose from. Declaring themselves as the true voice of the Woodland, the Hundreds can incite **mobs**, which destroy enemy buildings and tokens, and raid ruins for items.

    - name: Faction Rules and Abilities

        - name: Contempt for Trade.
          text: Whenever the Hundreds craft an item, they may take the item but score none of the listed victory points, or may remove the item permanently to score the listed victory points. _(They can still score extra crafting points from effects such as Master Engravers and the Legendary Forge.)_

        - name: The Hoard.
          text: Instead of a Crafted Items box, the Hundreds have the Hoard box. This has two tracks, Command and Prowess. The Command track can hold `item:boot`, `item:sack`, and `item:coin`. The Prowess track can hold `item:hammer`, `item:tea`, `item:sword`, and `item:crossbow`.

            - name: Command and Prowess.

      pretext: The Keepers in Iron are an order of devout knights, once exiled from the Woodland, who have returned to recover **relics** lost in past conflicts. Whether these relics belong to the Keepers or the Woodland, though, is another question. To accomplish their mission, they will need to delve relics out of the forests, move them to a **waystation** of the same type, and then recover them. When they recover a relic, they score points equal to the relic's value of one to three, and they also score two points each time they complete a set of the three relic types—figures, tablets, and jewelry. Over time, the Keepers will gather a **Retinue** of Woodland creatures, letting them take more actions. However, each time they delve a relic or recover one, they might lose the Retinue card they used to act, so they will need to plan ahead and take prudent risks in order to succeed.

              text: When a player gains a hireling card, they roll the control die and place control markers on the hireling card equal in number to the die roll.

              text: Hirelings cannot use their controller's abilities, crafted persistent effects, or ambush cards. _(So, a hireling could not use Boat Builders while moving, and the Highway Bandits could not be placed on a river. A hireling's controller could not play an ambush card while battling with the hireling.)_

            - name: No Scoring from Removal.
              text: A hireling's controller does not score victory points if their hireling removes an enemy piece _(usually in battle)_. _(Players can still score points by removing hireling buildings and tokens, even when defending in battle against the hireling. Players still score as normal if the Warm Sun Prophets force that player's faction pieces to battle.)_

            - name: Weird Stuff.
              text: If you move a hireling with the Ferry, you do draw a card. If you move hireling warriors into a clearing with an Alliance sympathy token or remove Alliance sympathy by using a hireling, this does trigger Outrage. _(These effects refer to a "player moving" or "player removing.")_
