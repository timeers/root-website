<h1>About the Database</h1>
<div>This is a collection of components for Root, the board game by Leder Games.</div>

<br>
<h3>How to Log In</h3>
<div>Log in using Discord's authentication service. This will use your Discord Display Name to create your profile and check that you are a member of the Root Discord community.</div>
<div>Once you are logged in you can record games and check player stats. You can also set up a password once your account has been created, but the perfered sign in method for now is through Discord.</div><br>

<h3>What This Isn't</h3>
This is not meant to be a social platform or a popularity contest. You can bookmark things that you like to find them quickly in the future, but Factions are not ranked on any basis.<br>
If a Faction is marked as 'stable' it means that it has been playtested and the designer does not plan to make any major changes.<br>
If you like the looks of something marked as 'stable' you should be able to find it at one of the provided links and use it in your game.<br>
<br>
{% endif %}
<h3>Something Missing?</h3>
If you see something that is missing or incorrect please reach out to let me know. Many hours went into what you see here but I'm just one person and probably missed quite a few things.<br><br>
