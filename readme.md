The goal is to have a website that lists official and unofficial Root content. 

There will be a list and search of Factions, Maps, Decks etc.
This section will have detailed info as well as stats.

There will be another section that lists gameplay details. 
Factions and other components used, score and players.

Users will be able to log in via Discord. 
If they belong to the WW discord server they will be able to record game results. 
They will not be able to edit the results once a game has been submitted. 
An admin will be able to edit or delete game data.

Some users will also be able to input new unofficial content which will be able to be selected in the gameplay section.
These users will be able to update or delete the content they posted.

Todo:
Fix validation on game submit form. 
Allow players to be added on game submit form without needing to edit.
Add expansion view that lists all components in an expansion.
Add component list on separate tab to player profiles. And remove current post list view.
